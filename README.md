# Blumiora (V1 - Paused)

**Status:** Development paused as of November 2025

## Why Paused
Pivoting to focus on shipping smaller, complete projects first. Will return to this concept with more experience and clearer MVP scope.

**Blumiora** is a space for creatives to connect, grow, and bloom — whether you paint, design, write, or simply dream.  
Currently in early development, starting with the landing page.

## 🚧 Project Status
- [x] Planning and initial design
- [x] Landing page (in progress)
- [x] Database schema design
- [x] Basic UI components
- [ ] Authentication and user profiles
- [ ] Community features
- [ ] Deployment  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Next.js  
- TypeScript  
- Tailwind CSS  

## Lessons Learned
- MVP definition needs to be ruthless
- Ship small, iterate later
- Scope management is critical

## 🎯 Vision
Most creative platforms (like Behance, DeviantArt, and Pinterest) focus on showcasing work — Blumiora aims to focus on *connection* and *community*.  

## Future Plans
May revisit this concept after gaining more full-stack experience.
